    <h2>Game Rules: </h2>
    <p> The object of Tic Tac Toe is to get three in a row. </p>
    <p> You play on a three by three game board. </p>
    <p> The first player is known as X and the second is O. </p>
    <p> Players alternate placing Xs and Os on the game board until either oppent has three in a row or all nine squares are filled. </p>
    <p> X always goes first, and in the event that no one has three in a row, the stalemate is called a cat game. </p>
